# Abstract 
In this lab report, I be discussing the use of the slave bible, otherwise known as “Parts of the Holy Bible, selected for the use of the Negro Slaves, in the British West-India Islands” as a tool of oppression during the slave trade. I will also be comparing the contents of the slave bible with the holy bible in order to reveal the agenda of the story crafted by a group of people attempting to justify their wrong doings. One such idea interpreted to suit the narrative, was absolute obedience to a master was the will of God.         

# Introduction 
The slave bible originally titled “Parts of the Holy Bible, selected for the use of the Negro Slaves, in the British West-India Islands” (Little 2019) published in 1807, was a tool used by slave owners to minimise the possibilities of the enslaved fighting back. This was done by filling the book, which slaves could not read due to language barriers, with messages glorifying submissive behaviour that were an exaggeration of stories interpreted from the Holy Bible.

The consensus around the use of the slave bible during the legal years of the practice, is that it was a tool of oppression. In a sense, this proves the old adage “knowledge is power” as those with the knowledge of the bibles chose to omit most of the Old Testament and parts of the new. This was thought to be done to reinforce the enslaved status on the people it applied to. The New Testament of the bible spoke a lot on love and peace, especially in loving “others as much as ‘one loves themselves’ ” (Summary of the Old & New Testament). This notion of love peace and understanding for fellow humans, was something not shown to slaves at the time. It was neither expected of them to show it in kind, as they were considered tools for farming and hard labour. 

From this point on, the “slave bible” will be referred to as the “book of enslavement” for clarification on how it is representative of the ideals of a select group of people forced on others as opposed to an actually religious text. Aided by Voyant, I will be diving into how the use of the book of enslavement during the trans Atlantic slave trade affected the relationship between the black population and settlers. This paper will also look at how white people of the past saw themselves at the top of the nonexistent hierarchy of humans based on race highlighted in the text.
